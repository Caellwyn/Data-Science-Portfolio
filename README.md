# Seattle Home Sales
Data Science Projects worthy of sharing
This is a project that I created for the capstone class of the IBM Data Science professional certificate from Coursera in March 2020.  It explores the Seattle housing market and tries to estimate home prices using data on the properties and data about nearby services. 
The notebooks for this project are split into 3 sequential pieces.
1. Data Wrangling: where I collect and format my dataset
2. Data Exploration: where I explore, map, and graph correlations within the dataset.
3. Data Modeling: where I test several linear regression models to determine how best to model the sales data and analyze the results.
